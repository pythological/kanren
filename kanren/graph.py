       Argument list containing terms that are walked and evaluated as

       An object that's a valid cdr for the collection type desired.  If

    null_res: bool
       Succeed on empty lists.
    use_ground_ordering: bool
        Order arguments by their "groundedness" before recursing.
    _first: bool
       Indicate whether or not this is the first iteration in a call to this
       goal constructor (in contrast to a recursive call).
       This is not a user-level parameter.
    _any_succeed: bool or None
       Indicate whether or not an iteration has succeeded in a recursive call

       `cars` should be checked (i.e. no "any" functionality).
       This is not a user-level parameter.
